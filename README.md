A versatile open-source 3D model viewer designed for seamless integration into any website. Leveraging the powerful three.js library, this foundation tool enables easy display and interaction with 3D models. The viewer is built to be highly accessible and compatible across different devices and browsers, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## What makes it accessible
- üìÑ Accessible customizable Settings: Remember when you used to modify the value of lines in the .ini file of your games? It's the same here: open the config.js file and select the viewer functionalities, simply set them to true or false.
- üìö **No dependencies:** The three.js library is alreary present in the repo.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Ease of installation:** The viewer can be implemented into any website in ~10min even by a beginner.

## Use cases
- üõçÔ∏è **Online Store Product Display:** Online retailers can implement the viewer to enhance product listings with 3D models, giving customers a more immersive understanding of product features, leading to increased engagement and conversion rates.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Artist Portfolio Showcase:** Artists can use the viewer to create a dynamic portfolio by embedding interactive 3D models into their websites, providing potential clients a detailed, hands-on experience with their creations.
- üîß **Virtual Prototyping:** Designers and engineers can leverage the viewer for virtual prototyping, allowing them to share interactive models with colleagues or clients, and receive feedback before manufacturing.
- üè´ **Educational Purposes:** Educators can use the viewer to teach students about complex structures or concepts in subjects like architecture, engineering, and biology, enabling interactive exploration of detailed models.
- üéÆ **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Development:** Game developers and AR/VR designers can preview models in 3D before exporting them to their final applications, ensuring assets are optimized for their projects.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Viewing:** Tools to rotate, zoom, and pan models to view them from any angle.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for performance on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Customizable UI:** Adjustable interface to cater to specific user needs and preferences.
- **Embeddable:** Easily integrate into web applications using simple embedding options.
- **Accessible customizable Settings:** Allows customization of lighting, background, and other display settings to enhance the viewing experience.
- **Automated support for your models:** scene, camera, renderer, window resize, light, shadows, reflections.
```javascript
const USE_BACKGROUND_TEXTURE = true; // Set this to true to enable background texture
const ADD_PLANE_TO_THE_SCENE = false; // Set this to true to add a plane to the scene
```

- **Control what your user can control**
```javascript
const ENABLE_INTERFACE = true; // Set this to true to enable the user interface
```

## Live demo
A live demo is present at https://tomcadene.com/projects/vanityviewer.html.
## Usage: 
Examples and documentation on how to use the viewer in various scenarios, such as in art showcases or online retail environments.

## Installation:
Instructions on how to set up and run the model viewer locally, including requirements and dependencies.

- Download the repo, extract it, add the vanityviewer-main folder in the root directory of your website.
- Inside the HTML file of the webpage that will contain the model viewer, add a script tag to include the JavaScript module.
```html
<script id="vanityviewer" type="module" src="vanityviewer-main/vanityviewer.js"></script>
```
- Add your GLTF model(s) in vanityviewer-main/models
- Add your HDR Environment(s) in vanityviewer-main/hdris
- Inside the HTML file of the webpage that will contain the model viewer, add the model viewer container div. This is the actual model viewer. make sure to replace the path with the path and name of the model and hdri files.
```html
<div class="vv" data-model-path="/models/brass_goblets_2k.gltf/brass_goblets_2k.gltf" data-hdri-path="/hdris/safari_sunset_2k.hdr" style="position: relative;"></div>
```
- You can add as many viewer as you want.
```html
<div class="vv" data-model-path="/models/brass_goblets_2k.gltf/brass_goblets_2k.gltf" data-hdri-path="/hdris/safari_sunset_2k.hdr" style="position: relative;"></div>
<div class="vv" data-model-path="/models/another_model.gltf" data-hdri-path="/hdris/another_hdri.hdr" style="position: relative;">
<div class="vv" data-model-path="/models/another_model.gltf" data-hdri-path="/hdris/another_hdri.hdr" style="position: relative;">
<div class="vv" data-model-path="/models/another_model.gltf" data-hdri-path="/hdris/another_hdri.hdr" style="position: relative;">
<div class="vv" data-model-path="/models/another_model.gltf" data-hdri-path="/hdris/another_hdri.hdr" style="position: relative;">
```
- In the vanityviewer-main folder open the config.js file, this is the configuration file where you will select the viewer functionalities.
- Select the viewer functionalities by changing their value by either true or false.
- And you should have a working viewer in your website, good job üòÄ.
