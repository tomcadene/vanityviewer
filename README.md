A versatile open-source 3D model viewer designed for seamless integration into any website. Leveraging the powerful three.js library, this foundation tool enables easy display and interaction with 3D models. The viewer is built to be highly compatible across different devices and browsers, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Use cases
- **Online Store Product Display:** Online retailers can implement the viewer to enhance product listings with 3D models, giving customers a more immersive understanding of product features, leading to increased engagement and conversion rates.
- **Artist Portfolio Showcase:** Artists can use the viewer to create a dynamic portfolio by embedding interactive 3D models into their websites, providing potential clients a detailed, hands-on experience with their creations.
- **Virtual Prototyping:** Designers and engineers can leverage the viewer for virtual prototyping, allowing them to share interactive models with colleagues or clients, and receive feedback before manufacturing.
- **Educational Purposes:** Educators can use the viewer to teach students about complex structures or concepts in subjects like architecture, engineering, and biology, enabling interactive exploration of detailed models.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Development:** Game developers and AR/VR designers can preview models in 3D before exporting them to their final applications, ensuring assets are optimized for their projects.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Viewing:** Tools to rotate, zoom, and pan models to view them from any angle.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for performance on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Customizable UI:** Adjustable interface to cater to specific user needs and preferences.
- **Embeddable:** Easily integrate into web applications using simple embedding options.
- **Accessible customizable Settings:** Allows customization of lighting, background, and other display settings to enhance the viewing experience.
```javascript
const USE_BACKGROUND_TEXTURE = true; // Set this to true to enable background texture
const ADD_PLANE_TO_THE_SCENE = false; // Set this to true to add a plane to the scene
```

- **Seamless integration into any website, reference your div and you're all set**
```javascript
const vvElement = document.querySelector('.vv');
```

- **Control what your user can control**
```javascript
const ENABLE_INTERFACE = true; // Set this to true to enable the user interface
```

- **Automated support for your models (scene, camera, renderer, window resize, light, reflections)**
```javascript
yourModel.castShadow = true;
yourModel.receiveShadow = true;
```
